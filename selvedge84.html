        We are surrounded by smooth surfaces, from screens to kitchen counters,
        floors and cars. And clothing is increasingly made from a narrow range of
        nylon and cotton fibre – while appealing to the eye, these leave the hand
        starved of stimulus.

        Issue 84 of Selvedge Magazine celebrates surface in all its forms; from
        Anni Albers’ textural weaving, Jane and Mary Parminter’s shell gallery,
        to Liciê Hunsche’s work with the fleece of Karakul sheep.

        Claudy Jongstra’s spongy felts, Hildur Bjarnadóttir’s delicate sheers,
        and Nicola Kilmartin’s fulled tweeds are all able to satisfy the hand
        as well as the eye.
