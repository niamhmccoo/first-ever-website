    ‘Japan Blue’ was coined by an English scholar who, visiting Japan in the 18th century,
    was struck by blue’s overwhelming presence. The Japanese archipelago is surrounded by
    it; it is observed in every doorway and in everyone’s clothes. This blue, it seemed,
    belonged to the country, and still does. Japan has a complex and obscure culture, and
    in this issue we begin to scratch the surface.
